Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Ans= the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. Ans= change analysis, release planning, system implementation, and releasing a system to customers


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Ans=  The phases include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. Ans= Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. Ans = Design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures. Document software defects, using a bug tracking system, and report defects to software developers. Identify, analyze, and document problems with program function, output, online screen, or content. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. Ans= is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. Ans=
Growing Customer Demands. ...
Time Constraints. ...
Limited Infrastructure. ...
Software Testing Conflicts. ...
Changing Requirements. ...
Limited Time and Resources. ...
Security.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. Ans= unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit tests focus on individual components, such as methods and functions, while integration tests check if these components work together properly.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. Ans = Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data. Further, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. Ans = Vague Prompt: "Tell me about sales"
